# DefendingTheThree
Final Project for my Generalized Linear Models Class

## Summary of project

With the surge in importance of three-point shooting in the NBA over the last decade or so, most teams have made creating open threes a focal point of their offensive system. Thus, the ability for teams to limit their opponents to a low three-point percentage has become paramount in today's NBA. But what kinds of players influence this statistic the most, and what traits do they have in common? This is the question I will be attempting to answer with my project. I will use a multilevel model approach in order to account for a player's team, since each NBA team defends the three differently and therefore will impact how its players are able to influence opponents' three point percentages on an individual basis. Athletic measurable data from the NBA combine will make up the level one predictors while team three point defense will be the level two predictor variable.
